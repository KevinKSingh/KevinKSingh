A little information on the files that I have uploaded. 

"cricket.py" is a Python script where I was trying to learn how to use numpy, matplotlib and pandas to post process and display cricket statistics from my own games in a nice way. For example, I wanted to know how much I averaged in the second innings of the game vs the first, or see how many runs I scored at a certain position or even month. This reads in a csv file where all the data is stored first. 

"solver_direct_mean.cpp" and "geometry_structure.cpp" are C++ codes from SU2 where I had implemented the necessary data structures and algorithms to successfully carry out the WENO reconstruction method in SU2 for a third and fifth order accurate scheme. 

"scrabble3.cpp" was a simple C++ script I made years ago to keep score of a game of scrabble involving 4 players. 

"league_stats.py" is me trying to learn how to use Python to fetch data from the Riot Games API for League of Legends to better learn how to use Data Science capabilities of Python by studying my own ranked games over my League accounts.
